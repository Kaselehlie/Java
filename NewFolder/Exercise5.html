 <h1>Caesar's Party Guest List</h1>

<body>
   <p>Following the success of his secret party, Julius Caesar decided to make it an annual event 🎉. Every year, a grand party would be held in a mysterious location, and Caesar needed to keep track of his guests 🤔.
</p> 
<p>This year, he wanted to use the Caesar Cipher again 🔐, but he had so many guests that he decided to use arrays to keep everything organized 📦. His scribe provided him with a list of names 📜, but Caesar realized he could use some of the array methods he had been studying to ensure the list was perfect 🧐.</p>
