    <h1>Graded Project Part 2: Exercise 7 - Meeting Again with Caesar's Best Friendh</h1>
<h2>
Previously on Springboard...</h2>

<p>In the heart of ancient Rome 🏛️, Julius Caesar had a secret 🤫. Not just about gladiators 🗡️ or gold 💰, but about... a party 🍾! This year, he would host a secret party only for his closest friends. This party was the talk of the town 🙊! There were magical fairies ✨, dancing peacocks 🦚, melodious harps 🎵, and sparkling fountains ⛲.</p>

<p>However, there was a problem 😲! Uninvited guests 🥷 would crash the party because the location 🗺️ would get leaked by spies 🕵️‍♂️.</p>

<p>Caesar needed a plan 💡! He thought, "I'll send out the invites encrypted 🔐. That way, only my true friends 🤝 will know when and where the party is!".</p>

<p>So, he came up with a cunning plan 🦊. Instead of writing the party location of the invitation directly 🏞️, he would shift each letter in by a fixed number 🔢. So, for example, if he decided to shift by 3:</p>

<p>- A would become D 🔄</p>
<p>- B would become E 🔄</p>
<p>- C would become F 🔄</p>
<p>- ... and so on.</p>

<p> the invite said "GARDEN" 🌳, he would write "JDUGHQ" 🤯.</p>

<p>When Brutus received the letter 📜, he knew about this secret code 🗝️. He would shift the letters back by the same number and decode "JDUGHQ" to "GARDEN" 🌳. Mmm, clever 🧠!</p>

<p>However, any nosy Romans 👀 intercepting the message would be baffled 😶‍🌫️! "JDUGHQ? What kind of place is that?" they would wonder 🤷‍♂️.</p>

<p>Thanks to the "Caesar Cipher" 🔐, Caesar's secret party remained exclusive 😼, magical 🌌, and crasher-free 🥳!</p>

<p>And while history 📖 might tell you that Brutus wasn't the most trustworthy of friends, at least in our story, he kept the party's secret 🎉 and never gave away the magical location 🌳! 😉🤫</p>

<p><h3> Exercise 📋</p></h3>

<p>You are given the below code.</p>


<p>const friend = "BRUTUS"</p>
<p>const shiftValue = 3;</p>
<hbr>

<p>Your objective is to encrypt the name "BRUTUS" using the Caesar Cipher technique and loops. Remember, we did it once for "B". Now, it's time to apply all letters.</p>
