    <h1>Caesar's Cipher Reloaded</h1>

    <p>
      In ancient Rome 🏛️, Julius Caesar was impressed by the effectiveness of
      his cipher. But as the secret parties grew more popular 🎉, manually
      shifting each letter became tedious. It was time for automation! Caesar
      summoned his best scribes and mathematicians 📜 to design a system - a
      system that could encrypt and decrypt messages at will!
